# Archie
ARCHIE is an archiving tool in development for researchers of the Leiden University working on the NEXUS 1492 project.

## Metadata extraction
The main goal of Archie is to provide researchers a simple tool for file metadata extraction.


## Installation
You can find the latest release on the [releases](https://github.com/NCMulder/Archie/releases) page. There, you can either download and run the `ARCHIE_V1_[version].exe` file (for Windows), or the `ARCHIE_V1_[version].jar` for all platforms. The .exe-file comes packed with Java, so you shouldn't have to install it yourself. If you come across any issues, please report them!
